# QRM_barometer

The QRM barometer is a proprietary research that compiles data from different sources and combines them to measure the overall risk in the market. It predicted the stock market local bottoms and tops from 2011 with high accuracy. Although the method of calculating QRM barometer is not shared online, I am uploading the daily QRM outputs on Twitter. Check out [@QRM_SPY_BTC](https://twitter.com/QRM_SPY_BTC) for more information. One of the projects, [rebalancing_strategy_ML_MPT](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/Rebalancing_Strategy_ML_MPT), uses the barometer to improve the performance of a rebalancing strategy in stock market.

## How to read the barometer:
### 1- The barometer is constrained between 0 and 1. 
### 2- The barometer has high correlation with the price of the underlying assets. 
### 3a- Reaching the extreme levels of the barometer prevents price from continuing the previous trend.
### 3b- At extreme levels of the barometer, price typically bounce or continue the trend after a short breath (barometer resets). 
### 4- Extreme levels of the barometer may be used to interpret the condition of market and predict the future price action (shown with green and red arrows).
